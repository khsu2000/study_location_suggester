# venue-suggester
This was my second personal project. I started this project during my the middle of sophomore spring semester at Berkeley and finished at the end of May 2020. I took on this project because I wanted to learn more about frontend development, as well as how the front and back ends of a web application work togther. Overall, this project was a good learning experience, and I was exposed to interesting, new software like Flask through building this site. 

The actual deployed site is here: https://venuesuggester.herokuapp.com/
